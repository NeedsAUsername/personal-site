<header class="center"><h3><strong>Ruby and Javascript - Scope, Variables, Functions</strong></h3></header>
<p>
	There's quite a few differences in how scope, variables, and functions are treated in Ruby versus in Javascript. To start off, Javascript uses lexical scoping, meaning that inner functions/closures have access to outer functions further up its scope chain.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code">
function outer() {
  let outerVar = 'hello';
  function innerVar() {
    console.log(outerVar);
  }
  innerVar();
}

outer() // hello
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Ruby methods, on the other hand, are closed off from all information outside of it. Inside Ruby methods, the only variables in scope are the ones declared within the function, and those passed through in arguments.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code">
outerVariable = 'hello'

def any_method
  puts outerVariable
end

any_method // undefined local variable or method `outerVariable'
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In Ruby, variables can be created in arguments, but methods can not. Not to mention it just looks really awkward with Ruby's def/end syntax. This clearly isn't how Ruby was intended to be used.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code">
def say_word(word)
  puts word
end

say_word(word =  'hello') // hello

say_word(def word 'hello' end) // syntax error
</pre>
</p>
<p>
In Javascript, however, functions are treated as first-class citizens, which is just a fancy way of saying that they are treated just like other plain variable. This enables functions to be declared and passed as arguments (We're going to be using an immediately invoked function so its value is passed instead of the function itself).
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
function sayWord(word) {
  console.log(word)
}

sayWord( word = 'hello') // hello

sayWord( (function(){return 'hello'})() ) // hello
</pre>
</p>


<p> Javascript’s arguments are also optional, whereas Ruby’s arguments are required and will bring up and error if you don’t provide them. As we can see, these languages take different approaches to writing code, each with their own style and personality.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to functions and variable scoping, Javascript is flexible ( maybe too flexible- don't get me started on its type coercion); it can create functions within arguments, and it allows all functions to access all variables above it in its scope chain. This freedom may come at a price, however, as variables can change and shift unexpectedly, as functions can easily get their hands on them.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Ruby is strict. Many people analogize Ruby methods to a living cell; self-reliant and only filtering in explicitly necessary outside resources through its cell walls. Planned, and methodical, this approach may seem limiting, but is less prone to variable mishaps, as every method is self-contained, and you're never unsure about a variable's value.

											</section>
											<h3><strong>Coding started out as just a hobby.</strong></h3>
											<p> I wanted to code out my own games and dedicated myself to it the summer between Junior and Senior year of college. I taught myself Python, and built a CLI RPG game. I then followed youtube tutorials to build a classic space shooter game, and a platformer game using Pygame.
											</p>
											<p>
											After school resumed, I forgot about coding until after I graduated Fordham with a degree in Finance. I originally studied finance because I was intrigued by the stock market, but realized that I wasn't interested in working in a hedge fund, or dealing with mergers/acquisitions, or being a financial analyst. The client side of financial advisory didn't appeal too much to me either, as they were basically glorified sales jobs.
											</p>
											<p>
											I thought back to my summer of Python, and realized it: what I really wanted to do was <strong>create things</strong>. I decided to delve into web development, and have since built projects from the ground up, learning every step of the way, from databases, to MVC, to APIs, to styling a site with CSS and Javascript. It's been tough- really tough! But when I look at what I've done, it's undoubtably worth it.
